restore_roman_empire_desc;With the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 475, the Eastern Roman Empire is the only half of the Roman Empire remaining. While this obviously means that it has assumed the territorial rights and responsibilites of its late twin, some in the West challenge this, taking the view that with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Roman dominion over the west has ended forever. They do not recognize the Eastern Roman Empire as having a right to the territory of the late Western Roman Empire, claiming that it only has a right to the territory assigned to it when the last united Roman Empire was divided. However if certain key territories of the late Western Roman Empire could be reclaimed, the Eastern Roman Empire could force these rouge barbarian kings to recognize it's heirdom to the Western Provinces, allowing it to proclaim the Roman Empire united for the first time since the reign of Emperor Jovian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.20;A United Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.20;As a solution to the administrative nightmare that became obvious during the Crisis of the Third Century, it became practice in the Roman Empire to divide the empire in two, with the Western Roman Empire being one half, and the Eastern Roman Empire being the other. While some emperors might, through politics, war, intrigue, or pure luck, come to rule both halves at once, and thus a united Roman Empire, and might even pass a united empire on to their heir, it was much more common to divide it between two sons. Even if an emperor who ruled a united Roman Empire passed the it on to a single heir, that heir would often, either immediately or after some time, divide the empire themselves, often giving the half they did not prefer to a brother or other trusted associate. This practice of dividing the empire was seldom noticable from anything more than an administrative standpoint, the people simply called themselves Roman, and thought of the Roman Empire as one entity. \n\nThere was only one problem with this state of affairs, and that problem was that while the Eastern Roman Empire thrived and prospered, the Western Roman Empire was collapsing. After spending the 400s losing ground, a wave of politcal instability hit it in the early 470s, culminating in a boy, Romulus Augustus, becoming Western Roman Emperor. Being merely a puppet for his ambitious father, the Western Roman Empire, already a shadow of it's former self, began to collapse completely. Seeing his chance, a barbarian king, Odoacer, took advantage of the chaos and invaded, and in 475, the Western Roman Empire fell. \n\nThis turn of affairs left the Eastern Roman Empire as the only half of the Roman Empire left, and while this would obviously make it the united Roman Empire by default, and thus legally entitled to and responsible for the territory of the Western Roman Empire, some in the west contested this fact. They claimed that with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Roman dominion over the west had ended forever, and that the Eastern Roman Empire was not entitled to the territory of the late Western Roman Empire. Despite these claims having no basis in Roman law, the Eastern Roman Empire was not in a position to force them to recognize it's status as the heir of the Western Roman Empire, and thus the united Roman Empire. However, with the recovery of certain key territories of the late Western Roman Empire, it has come to pass that the Eastern Roman Empire is no longer merely the united Roman Empire in law, but in reality as well, this has created a situation where it can no longer be denied, even by the most stubborn barbarians, that the Eastern Roman Empire is in fact the united Roman Empire, both in law and in reality. \n\nNevertheless, there is still work to be done, there is still a great deal of former Roman territory that languishes under the control of barbarian kings, and it must be retaken! Even once this is achieved, there is more land to conquer, and with it more people to civilize, enlighten, and romanize! For the Senate and People of Rome! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.21;Under Roman Law, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 475, the Eastern Roman Empire legally became the whole, united Roman Empire in it's duties and rights. This however, did not stop many barbarians in the west from claiming that with the Western Roman Empire's fall, roman rule over the west had ended forever, and that the Eastern Roman Empire was only entitled to the territory allotted to it during the most recent division of the Roman Empire, after the death of the Emperor Jovian. Now, however, the Eastern Roman Empire has retaken enough of the key territories of the late Western Roman Empire that it can no longer be denied that it is in fact the united Roman Empire, both in law and in reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
