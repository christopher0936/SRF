restore_roman_empire_desc;With the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 475, the Eastern Roman Empire is the only half of the Roman Empire remaining. While this obviously means that it has assumed the territorial rights and responsibilites of its late twin, some in the West challenge this, taking the view that with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Roman dominion over the west has ended forever. They do not recognize the Eastern Roman Empire as having a right to the territory of the late Western Roman Empire, claiming that it only has a right to the territory assigned to it when the last united Roman Empire was divided. However if certain key territories of the late Western Roman Empire could be reclaimed, the Eastern Roman Empire could force these rouge barbarian kings to recognize it's heirdom to the Western Provinces, allowing it to proclaim the Roman Empire united for the first time since the reign of Emperor Jovian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLoR.20;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! After the miraculous recovery of territory lost centuries ago, the Roman Empire has been reborn! Europe has endured dark times since the imperial frontiers were stormed by barbarians and province after province burned at their touch, but now a bright new age has dawned for all of civilization.\n\nThe Roman State will no longer be referred to as the "Empire of the Greeks" by jealous pretenders in the West, but recognized as the true heir to the legacy of Rome. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] rules a restored Imperium Romanum, but much work remains to be done. There is still territory to recover and ancient borders to reclaim. For the Senate and People of Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
